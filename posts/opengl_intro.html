    <h1>Introduction</h1>

    <h2>Preface</h2>

    <p>
        The intent of this series is to mainly document my own learning process, and act as a reference in the future
        when I inevitably forget about everything.

    <aside>
        If you're wondering why everything is slightly left of center, it's because I like to put figures and little notes like these in my margins! On a mobile device, it collapses into the main container (and isn't very useful).
    </aside>

    <p>
        I am not a graphics programmer by trade, and there will likely be some mistakes and dodgy code in these posts.
        The reason I'm still writing it is solely because resources for the later versions of OpenGL (which focus on
        DSA, Vertex Pulling and other modern concepts) are fairly limited. Most professionals have moved on to Vulkan,
        but for a hobbyist, learning Vulkan is a huge time investment that doesn't seem particularly enjoyable or
        worthwhile.
    </p>

    <p>
        There are some extremely useful resources that lay out how to use the modern functions introduced in OpenGL 4.1
        and onwards, but most only cover small aspects of the overall package and don't tend to look at the overall
        architecture of an OpenGL renderer that utilises modern GPU architecture effectively. I've referenced these
        sources extensively throughout my posts.
    </p>

    <p>
        These posts are more of a narrative exploration of OpenGL 4.6, with the goal being a simple but optimised
        rendering pipeline that avoids any OpenGL functions that have been replaced with more performant options in
        recent extensions of the API. Each post focuses on a particular feature or concept, starting with the heavily
        unoptimised naive approach, and then gradually iterating until we end up with something decent! I try to include
        benchmarks wherever possible, so that we can get an idea of how each change impacts our renderer.
    </p>

    <h2>An extremely vague history of OpenGL</h2>

    <p>
        OpenGL was created in the early 90s, as a standardised interface for interacting with fairly limited graphics
        hardware. It provided software implementations of features that weren't supported by the underlying hardware,
        which was pretty great back in the day when GPUs were either extremely simplistic hardware that could only
        really handle basic rasterisation and texture sampling, or just CPUs with a software rasteriser!
    </p>

    <p>
        As time went on, that abstraction began to become a problem. Graphics programmers started to rely on the GPU
        more, and avoiding expensive data transfer between the GPU and CPU became crucial for performance. GPUs weren't
        just CPUs with a different name, they had drastically different underlying structures and required a completely
        different approach.
    </p>

    <p>
        This led to the creation of modern graphics APIs, like Vulkan, Metal, DX12, etc. These APIs are much more
        closely mapped to the underlying GPU architecture, giving developers explicit control over GPU memory.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, prior to the creation of Vulkan (which was essentially a direct successor to OpenGL), a lot of new
        extensions were brought into OpenGL<span class="margin-number"></span>! These extensions didn't exactly give <i>perfect</i> control over the GPU,
        but they did make it possible to use a lot of the same concepts that would be utilised later on in Vulkan.
    </p>

    <aside>
        The <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/History_of_OpenGL#Summary_of_version_changes">OpenGL wiki</a> details the additions that each version of OpenGL brings into the core library. Most of the functions we'll be relying on were added somewhere between 4.1 and 4.6
    </aside>

    <p>
        In order to use these extensions, we have to limit ourselves to the latest version of OpenGL: 4.6. This still
        has pretty great legacy hardware support, given that it was released in mid 2017, but gives us access to
        everything we need to write modern OpenGL code.
    </p>

    <h2>Why not just use Vulkan?</h2>

    <p>
        Vulkan is considerably lower-level, but also considerably less crufty.
    </p>

    <p>
        A good example of the differences is comparing the code for drawing a triangle in Vulkan to drawing a triangle
        in OpenGL, in C
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>vulkan_triangle.c</b> is roughly 1k lines of code, ignoring some comments and window setup.
        In reality, most of this code is one-time setup of the Vulkan pipeline, but it illustrates just how much control
        a graphics programmer is given over the underlying hardware.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>opengl_triangle.c</b> is roughly 125 lines of code, again ignoring comments and window setup.
    </p>

    <h2>The State Machine</h2>

    <p>
        OpenGL is essentially a giant state machine. State is globally shared in the OpenGL context, and commands are
        executed sequentially.
    </p>

    <p>
        This has performance implications, as binding buffers and shaders is pretty expensive due to the data transfer
        between the CPU and GPU. It also creates a lot of annoying mistakes where commands executed early on in the
        program cause problems with later commands. Essentially, it means that one function called with the exact same
        arguments can result in completely different outcomes depending on the current state.
    </p>

    <p>
        With Modern OpenGL, and some well-written utility code, we can manage to avoid a lot of these problems due to
        the addition of <a href=""
            http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/ARB/direct_state_access.txt>ARB_direct_state_access</a> (Direct State
        Access, or DSA).
    </p>
    <p>
        Before DSA, we would have to <i>bind</i> a buffer to the global context as the <i>current</i> buffer then
        configuring it using commands that modify the <i>current</i> buffer. Instead, we create a <i>named</i> buffer
        with a unique ID, and then pass that ID into the new DSA functions. Nothing is bound to the global state, so
        every command is pure and relies purely on its arguments. Sadly there is still <b>some</b> global state, so
        things aren't perfect, but it's a considerable step up from the old days!
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>
        OpenGL has a lot of pitfalls due to backwards compatibility and general design issues that can't really be
        resolved, but if you can avoid the cruft it can fairly performant and easy to use. In terms of hardware
        compatibility, it supports an older set of GPUs (even with OpenGL 4.6) but has pretty limited support on macOS,
        as Apple stopped supporting OpenGL beyond 4.1.

    <p>
        In general, OpenGL 4.6 is ideal for targeting Windows/Linux systems. If you do need to target hardware from
        earlier than the 2010s, you can use OpenGL 4.1 and have access to most modern functionality via extensions, but
        it's generally not necessary.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the next post, we'll do some basic setup using Glutin + Winit (Rust equivalent of GLFW) and draw a triangle
        using DSA.
